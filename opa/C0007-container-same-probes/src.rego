# @title Container liveness probe and readiness probe should be different
#
# When Liveness and Readiness probes are pointing to the same endpoint,
# the effects of the probes are combined.
# When the app signals that it's not ready or live,
# the kubelet detaches the container from the Service and delete it at the same time.
